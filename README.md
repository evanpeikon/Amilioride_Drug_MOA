# ðŸ§¬ Project Introduction

In this project repository I'll be analyzing RNA-sequencing data from a study titled, [Amiloride, An Old Diuretic Drug, Is a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Multiple Myeloma](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/23/21/6602/259285/Amiloride-An-Old-Diuretic-Drug-Is-a-Potential). 

In this study, myeloma cell lines and a xenograft mouse model (i.e., a mouse with human tumor cells implanted in it) were used to evaluate the drug amiloride's toxicity (i.e., cell-killing effects). Additionally, amilioride's mechanism of action was investigated using RNA-Seq experiments, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays.

The investigators in this study found amiloride-induced apoptosis in a broad panel of multiple myeloma cell lines and in the xenograft mouse model. Additionally, they found that amiloride has a synergistic effect when combined with other drugs, such as dexamethasone and melphalan.

In this project repository, I will analyze the RNA-sequencing data from this study, made available via the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), to better understand amiloride's mechanism of action and effects, with special attention dedicated to analyzing differentially expressed genes and their physiological functions. If you're unfamiliar with differential expression analysis and how it works, I recommend reading the provided documentation titled [Scientific Background](https://github.com/evanpeikon/GSE_95077/blob/project_branch_2/scientific_background.md) before proceeding. 

# ðŸ§¬ Project Walkthrough 

## Data Availability
The data for this project comes from a study called "Amiloride, An Old Diuretic Drug, Is a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Multiple Myeloma," which is accessible via the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) via the following accession number: [GSE95077](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95077). 

Additionally, we can access the bulk RNA-sequencing data, from each sample, using the following accension numbers: [GSM2495770](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495770) , [GSM2495771](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495771) , [GSM2495772](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495772) , [GSM2495767](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495767) , [GSM2495768](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495768) , [GSM2495769](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2495769).

## Import Libraries
Before loading the data above, I'll first import the following Python libraries, which will be used in downstream analyses:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from gprofiler import GProfiler
from collections import defaultdict
import mygene
import gseapy as gp
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

## Load, Inspect, and Prepare Data
Next, we'll use Bash's ```wget``` command to retrieve our bulk RNA-seq data, and following that, we'll use the Bash ```gunzip``` command to decompress the files:

```python
# get data from GEO and decompress file
!wget -O GSE95077_Normalized_Count_Matrix_JJN3_Amiloride_and_CTRL.txt.gz 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE95077&format=file&file=GSE95077%5FNormalized%5FCount%5FMatrix%5FJJN3%5FAmiloride%5Fand%5FCTRL%2Etxt%2Egz'

!gunzip GSE95077_Normalized_Count_Matrix_JJN3_Amiloride_and_CTRL.txt
```
Following that, we'll load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and inspect the first 5 rows of data. 

```python
# define the file path, load the data into a DataFrame, and view the first 5 rows
file_path = 'GSE95077_Normalized_Count_Matrix_JJN3_Amiloride_and_CTRL.txt'
data_frame = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep='\t', index_col=0)
data_frame.head()
```
Which, produces the following output:

<img src="images/data_head.png" alt="Description" width="1000" height="175">

The data frame above is indexed by Ensemble gene ID (ENSG), and then there are six columns of RNA-sequencing expression data (i.e., counts). The first three columns contain expression counts for the experimental group (i.e., the amiloride treatment group), and the last three columns contain expression counts for the control group. Note that both groups use the JJN3 cell line, which was established from the bone marrow of a 57-year-old woman with plasma cell leukemia.

Next, we'll want to perform preliminary data analysis to understand the distribution and variability of RNA sequencing counts across the samples and check for missing data before performing any downstream analysis. First, let's check out our sample quality:

```python
# check for missing values 
print(data.isnull().sum())
```
Which, produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_1.png" alt="Description" width="200" height="125">

Notably, the dataset has no null (missing) values. Now, the next step in our data preperation process is to get the corresponding gene names for each Ensemble gene ID in our data set, then add said gene names to a new column, which i'll demonstrate in the code block below. 

```python
mg = mygene.MyGeneInfo() # initialize MyGeneInfo object to query gene information
ensembl_ids = data_frame.index.tolist() # extract ensemble IDs from index of DF
gene_info = mg.querymany(ensembl_ids, scopes='ensembl.gene', fields='symbol', species='human') # query MyGeneInfo for gene symbols using ensemble IDs
gene_df = pd.DataFrame(gene_info) # convert query result to DF
gene_df = gene_df.dropna(subset=['symbol']).drop_duplicates(subset='query') # drop rows w/ missing gene symbols and duplicate ensemble IDs
data_frame['Gene_Name'] = data_frame.index.map(gene_df.set_index('query')['symbol']) # map ensemble IDs to gene symbols and add gene names to a new column in the original DF
cols = ['Gene_Name'] + [col for col in data_frame.columns if col != 'Gene_Name'] # reorder columns to place 'Gene_Name' as the first column
data_frame = data_frame[cols] # rearrange DF columns
```
Next, we'll drop the current index in the DataFrame containing the Ensemble gene IDs, then make the first column, containing gene names, our new index. 

```python
# drop current index w/ ensemble IDs, then make column 0 w/ gene names the new index
data_frame = data_frame.reset_index(drop=True)
data_frame = data_frame.set_index(data_frame.columns[0])
data_frame.head()
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_2.png" alt="Description" width="1000" height="175">

Next, we'll explore the distribution and variability in our dataset, as demonstrated in the code block below:
```python
# calcualte total counts per sample and log transform counts
total_counts = data_frame.sum(axis=0)
log_counts = data_frame.apply(lambda x: np.log2(x + 1))

# create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(18, 6))

# plot total counts per sample
axes[0].bar(data_frame.columns, total_counts, color='skyblue')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Total Counts')
axes[0].set_title('Total Counts per Sample')
axes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=85)

# plot log transformed counts per sample
log_counts.boxplot(ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_ylabel('Log2(Counts + 1)')
axes[1].set_title('Log Transformed Counts per Sample')
axes[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=85)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/EDA.png" alt="Description" width="1000" height="450">

The chart on the left, titled "Total Counts Per Sample," helps visualize the overall sequencing depth across the samples. Ideally, the bars, representing the total counts, should be of similar height, indicating that sequencing depth is consistent across samples, which is the case with this data set. 

Conversely, the rightmost chart is used to assess the variability and distribution of gene expression counts across samples. In this case, we can see that the boxes, representing the interquartile range, and the whiskers, representing variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, are of similar sizes across the samples, indicating a consistent data distribution. 

Now, before moving on to quality control and filtering, we'll use one last visualization to explore the similarity, or dissimilarity, between our six samples:
```python
# perform hierarchical clustering and create dendrogram
h_clustering = linkage(log_counts.T, 'ward')
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
dendrogram(h_clustering, labels=data.columns)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.ylabel('Distance')
plt.show()
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/denodrogram1.png" alt="Description" width="400" height="450">

The image above shows the results of hierarchical clustering, which can be visualized via a dendrogram. When viewing a dendrogram, special attention should be paid to the cluster groupings and branches. Samples clustered together are more similar to each other, and the length of the branches (vertical lines) connecting clusters represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters. 

The chart above shows that our three control samples are clustered on the right, whereas our three experimental (i.e.,m amiloride-exposed) samples are clustered together on the left. This is a good sign, suggesting that the control and experimental groups are distinct and that there is biological variation between the two groups of samples. Thus, we can feel confident that our downstream differential expression analyses will provide meaningful results. 

## Quality Control, Filtering, and Normalization

The next step in our analysis is to filter out genes with low expression levels across all samples, which can introduce noise in the data. By filtering these out, you can make your results more reliable and improve your statistical power, making detecting real biological differences between conditions easier. Additionally, filtering out genes with low expression counts decreases computational load by reducing the number of genes in your dataset, making future downstream analyses faster. 

To determine the optimal filtering criteria, I'll plot the number of genes retained with different filtering criteria, as demonstrated below. 

```python
def plot_genes_retained_by_cpm(data, min_samples=3):
    """
    Plots the number of genes retained as a function of different CPM thresholds
    
    Parameters:
    - data: DF with raw count data where rows are genes and columns are samples.
    - min_samples: min number of samples in which a gene must have a CPM greater than the threshold to be retained.
    """
    # convert raw counts to CPM to normalize the data
    cpm = data.apply(lambda x: (x / x.sum()) * 1e6)

    # define a range of CPM thresholds to test, from 0 to 5 with increments of 0.1
    thresholds = np.arange(0, 5, 0.1)
    
    # initialize list to store the # of genes retained for ea/ threshold
    genes_retained = []

    # loop through ea/ threshold value to determine the # of genes retained
    for min_cpm in thresholds:
        # create mask where CPM > min_cpm in at least min_samples samples
        mask = (cpm > min_cpm).sum(axis=1) >= min_samples
        
        # count # of genes that meet the criteria and append to the list
        genes_retained.append(mask.sum())

    # plot # of genes retained as a function of CPM threshold
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(thresholds, genes_retained, marker='o', color='green')
    
    # add vertical line at CPM = 1 as a rough heuristic for comparison
    plt.axvline(x=1.0, color='red', linestyle='--', label='CPM = 1')

    # add labels
    plt.xlabel('Threshold (CPM)')
    plt.ylabel('Num Genes Retained')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# call function
plot_genes_retained_by_cpm(data_frame)
```
<img src="images/DEA_3.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="400">

Based on the data in the chart above, we'll filter genes with an expression threshold of <0.75 CPM. For many bulk RNA-seq datasets, a CPM threshold of 1 is a common filtering point, but 0.75 is slightly more lenient is justifiable given the distribution of our data. Now, In the code block below, I'll show you how perform basic filtering and normalization. 

```python
def filter_normalize(data, min_cpm=0.75, min_samples=3):
    """
    Filter and normalize gene expression data.

    Parameters:
    - data: raw gene expression data where rows represent genes and columns represent samples.
    - min_cpm: min counts per million (CPM) threshold for filtering genes.
    - min_sample: min number of samples with CPM above min_cpm to keep a gene.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: filtered and normalized gene expression data.
    """
    
    # convert raw counts to CPM
    cpm = data.apply(lambda x: (x / x.sum()) * 1e6)  
    
    # filter genes based on CPM thresholds
    mask = (cpm > min_cpm).sum(axis=1) >= min_samples # keep genes with CPM > min_cpm in at least min_samples
    filtered_data = data[mask]  # apply filter 

    # Compute geometric mean of non-zero values for each gene
    geometric_means = filtered_data.apply(lambda row: np.exp(np.log(row[row > 0]).mean()), axis=1)
    
    # calculate size factors by dividing each gene expression by its geometric mean
    size_factors = filtered_data.div(geometric_means, axis=0).median(axis=0)
    
    # normalize data by dividing each gene expression by the size factors
    normalized_data = filtered_data.div(size_factors, axis=1)

    # return normalized data as DF w/ the same index and columns as the filtered data
    return pd.DataFrame(normalized_data, index=filtered_data.index, columns=filtered_data.columns)

# overwrite DF with filtered and normalized data
data_frame = filter_normalize(data_frame)
```

## Differential Expression Analysis
Now that we've loaded our data and performed quality control and normalization, we can perform differential expression analysis. In this case, I used a pairwise analysis, which involves comparing gene expression levels between individual pairs of control and experimental samples. For example, I compared control sample 1 to experimental sample 1, control sample 2 to experimental sample 2, etc. 

Pairwise analyses are useful when working with small sample sizes, as we currently are. Additionally, pairwise comparison can be more precise because it compares matched samples, reducing variability caused by biological differences between samples and batch effects. In the code block below, I'll demonstrate how to perform a pairwise analysis, multiple testing corrections, and how to identify differentially expressed genes:

```python
# initilize list to store results for each gene
results = []

for gene in data_frame.index:
    # extract treated group data for the current gene
    treated = data_frame.loc[gene, ['JJ_AMIL_141050_INTER-Str_counts', 'JJ_AMIL_141056_INTER-Str_counts', 'JJ_AMIL_141062_INTER-Str_counts']]
    # extract control group data for the current gene
    control = data_frame.loc[gene, ['JJ_CTRL_141048_INTER-Str_counts', 'JJ_CTRL_141054_INTER-Str_counts', 'JJ_CTRL_141060_INTER-Str_counts']]

    # calculate mean expression levels for control and treated groups
    mean_control = np.mean(control)
    mean_treated = np.mean(treated)

    # compute log2 fold change, adding 1 to avoid taking log of 0
    log2fc = np.log2((mean_treated + 1) / (mean_control + 1))  # Adding 1 to avoid log of 0

    # perform t-test to compare control and treated groups
    t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(control, treated)

    # append results for the current gene to the results list
    results.append({'gene': gene, 'log2fc': log2fc, 't_stat': t_stat, 'p_val': p_val})

# convert results list to DF for easier manipulation
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# convert p-values to numeric values, coercing errors to NaN if conversion fails, then drop rows where p-values are NaN
results_df['p_val'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['p_val'], errors='coerce')
results_df = results_df.dropna(subset=['p_val'])

# extract p-values as a numpy array for multiple testing correction
pvals = results_df['p_val'].values  # Convert to numpy array

# apply multiple testing correction using Benjamini-Hochberg method
results_df['p_adj'] = multipletests(results_df['p_val'], method='fdr_bh')[1]

# calculate the absolute value of log2 fold change
results_df['abs_log2fc'] = results_df['log2fc'].abs()

# filter results to get differentially expressed genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |log2fc| > 1
deg = results_df[(results_df['p_adj'] < 0.05) & (results_df['abs_log2fc'] > 1)]
```

The code above performs a differential expression analysis on gene expression data, and the final output, ```deg```, is a DataFrame containing the genes that are significantly differentially expressed between the control and treated samples. Now that we have a dataframe of differentially expressed genes, we can view the distribution of Absolute log fold changes, as demonstrated in the code block below. 

```python
# view distribution of scores
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(deg['abs_log2fc'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Absolute log2FC from Differential Expression Analysis')
plt.xlabel('abs_log2fc')
plt.ylabel('Frequency (# of genes)')
plt.show()
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_4.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="350">

Notably, the image above displays the total number of genes at each absolute log-2 fold change. You'll notice that the bulk of genes hover around of low-end threshold of 1.0, with a small subset of genes having an absolute log-2 fold change of >2.0. 

## ðŸ§« Visualizing Differentially Expressed Genes
The first visualization we'll use to understand our data is a volcano plot. A volcano plot is a type of scatter plot commonly used in genomics and other areas of bioinformatics to visualize the results of differential expression analysis and help identify statistically significant changes in gene expression between different conditions. In the code block below, I'll demonstrate how to create a volcano plot using our data frame of filtered differentially expressed genes. The first plot will be from our ```results_df``` DataFrame before filtering, then the second plot will be from our ```deg``` DataFrame, a after filtering out genes that do not meet our selection criteria:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=results_df, x='log2fc', y='p_adj', hue='log2fc', palette='viridis', alpha=0.9, edgecolor=None)
plt.axhline(y=0.05, color='red', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)
plt.axvline(x=1, color='blue', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)
plt.axvline(x=-1, color='blue', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)
plt.xlabel('log2 Fold Change')
plt.ylabel('Adjusted P-value')
plt.legend(title='log2 Fold Change', loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```
Which, produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_5.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="400">

As you can see in the image above, our volcano plot combines two critical pieces of information for each gene: the magnitude of change (fold change) and the statistical significance (p-value) of that change. Specifically, the x-axis on this graph shows the log2 fold change between the control and experimental samples in our pairwise analysis. A positive value indicates an upregulation of a gene in the experimental group compared to the control, and a negative value represents downregulation of a gene in the experimental group compared to the control. Additionally, the y-axis shows the significance of said change in gene expression. Thus, when viewing this graph, we are most interested in the two boxes formed in the lower left and lower right corners, which represent down-regulated and up-regulated genes with high statistical significance. 

Now, in the code block below, I'll show you how to produce a volcano plot containing only genes that met our filtering criteria:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=deg, x='log2fc', y='p_adj', hue='log2fc', palette='viridis', alpha=0.9, edgecolor=None)
plt.axhline(y=0.05, color='red', linestyle='-', linewidth=1) 
plt.axvline(x=1, color='blue', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)  
plt.axvline(x=-1, color='blue', linestyle='-', linewidth=1) 
plt.xlabel('log2 Fold Change')
plt.ylabel('Adjusted P-value')
plt.legend(title='log2 Fold Change', loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```
Which, produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_6.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="400">

Notably, the data in this second volcano plot is much more sparse, as it only contains genes that met our filtering criteria of an adjusted p-value <0.05 and a log2 fold change >1. However, this plot does little to show us how these genes are related to one another, which will help us unravel amiloride's physiological effects. To better understand that, we can perform hierarchical clustering, which can help us understand how genes with differential expression are related and identify clusters of genes that may be similarly affected by the drug treatment.

The first hierarchical clustering visualization we'll explore is a heatmap, which provides an integrated view of the data, showing not only how samples or features group together but also the magnitude of their values. In this code block below, I'll show you how to create this type of visualization:

```python
significant_genes = deg['gene'].tolist()
data_sig = data_frame.loc[significant_genes]
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_sig_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(data_sig.T).T, index=data_sig.index, columns=data_sig.columns)
sns.clustermap(data_sig_scaled, method='ward', cmap='viridis', metric='euclidean', figsize=(10, 10), dendrogram_ratio=(0.2, 0.2))
plt.show()
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_7.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="600">

Looking at the figure above, you should note that the rows and columns are clustered by sample and fold change. The three leftmost columns correspond to the control samples, and the three rightmost columns correspond to the experimental samples. In contrast, the y-axis is grouped based on whether genes were up or downregulated. For example, in the left corner of the plot, you'll fnd genes who expressionlevel is elevated in the control sample relative to the experimental sample, whereas in the bottom right corner you'll find genes who expression is lower in the control sample relative to the experimental sample. 

Additionally, the colors in the plot represent the magnitude of change, as described in the key in the upper left corner of the image. This chart also features both x-axis and y-axis dendrograms. The x-axis dendrogram at the top of the image clusters the samples by condition, whereas the y-axis dendrogram clustered genes based on their expression profiles and similarity.

In general, genes are grouped in clusters based on their expression profiles across samples, and thus, genes with similar expression profiles are more likely to be clustered together. Additionally, genes with similar functions or involved in related biological processes tend to cluster together as well (though this isn't always the case). 

## Functional Enrichment Analysis
**Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis**

Now that we've identified a number of differentially expressed genes, we'll perform a series of functional enrichment analyses, which allow us to identify and interpret the biological functions, processes, and pathways that are overrepresented or significant in our list of differenrentially expressed genes, thus helping us uncover Amilioride's mechansm of action. 

The first analysis we'll explore is Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, which categorizes differentially expressed genes according to their associated biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. This categorization is based on a structured, hierarchical vocabulary known as the Gene Ontology, which systematically describes gene functions. 

While differential expression analysis identifies genes that are up- or down-regulated in response to an intervention, treatment, or drug regimen, GO analysis takes this a step further by linking these genes to broader biological contexts. By grouping genes into functional categories, GO analysis can reveal which biological processes, molecular functions, or cellular components are impacted, offering a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms through which an intervention, treatment, or drug exerts its effects.

Now, I'll show you how to perform  GO analysis, as demonstrated in the code block below.

```python
# extract the list of gene names for differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
gene_list = deg['gene'].tolist() # convert the 'gene' column from the DataFrame containing DEGs to a list
gp = GProfiler(return_dataframe=True) # initialize g:Profiler for functional enrichment analysis. Set return_dataframe=True to get results in a DataFrame format
go_results = gp.profile(organism='hsapiens', query=gene_list) # perform Gene Ontology (GO) analysis using the list of significant genes
print(go_results.head()) # display the first few rows of the results to review the analysis output
```
Which produces the following outputs:

<img src="images/DEA_8.png" alt="Description" width="500" height="400">

The gene ontology (GO) analysis results offer significant insights into the effects of the potential cancer drug. Key findings include the identification of several highly significant biological processes and cellular components, such as "cytoplasm," "small molecule metabolic process," and "Mitochondrial inheritance." These terms highlight both broad and specific biological processes and conditions influenced by the drug.

The precision and recall values for these terms reveal varying degrees of relevance and coverage. For instance, "cytoplasm" has high precision (0.735) but low recall (0.024), meaning that while this term is highly relevant to the identified genes, only a small portion of the relevant genes were captured. Conversely, terms like "Leber optic atrophy" exhibit high recall (0.800) but lower precision (0.061), indicating that although many relevant genes were identified, the specificity of these associations is lower.

In the context of evaluating a potential cancer drug, these results are particularly informative. The drug's impact on fundamental cellular processes, such as those involving the cytoplasm and small molecule metabolism, suggests potential pathways through which the drug may exert its effects. Additionally, the identification of terms related to specific diseases may reveal potential off-target effects or broader impacts of the drug, guiding further research and development.

**Pathway Analysis**

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis is useful for identifying broad biological changes associated with gene expression, but it may not always pinpoint specific pathways affected by drug treatment. To address this limitation, we will also perform pathway analysis. Pathway analysis focuses on identifying signaling and metabolic pathways that are enriched among differentially expressed genes, providing insights into how these genes interact within specific biological pathways.

While GO analysis offers a general overview of biological processes and cellular components, pathway analysis provides a more detailed perspective. It maps differentially expressed genes to established biological pathways, such as those documented in KEGG or Reactome databases. This approach clarifies how genes collaborate within biological systems and highlights key pathways altered by the drug treatment. This detailed understanding is crucial for unraveling complex biological mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

For studying the effects of a cancer drug, pathway analysis is particularly valuable. It helps identify specific biological processes and pathways influenced by the drug, revealing insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its impact on cellular functions. For example, detecting pathways related to energy metabolism and oxidative stress can elucidate how the drug affects cellular processes crucial for cancer progression. Below, I will show you how to perform pathway analysis using the code provided.

```python
# perform pathway analysis and display the results 
pathway_analysis_results = gp.profile( organism='hsapiens',  query=gene_list, sources=["KEGG", "REAC"])
print(pathway_analysis_results.head())
```
Which produces the following output:

<img src="images/DEA_9.png" alt="Description" width="600" height="500">

In the context of myeloma therapy, these pathway analysis results suggest that the drug has a notable impact on key energy and metabolic pathways. By affecting the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and related metabolic processes, the drug may impair the energy production and metabolic adaptability of myeloma cells. Additionally, the influence on ROS-related pathways highlights the potential for the drug to induce oxidative stress or disrupt ROS management, offering further insights into its mechanism of action. Overall, these findings suggest that the drug might effectively target critical processes in myeloma cells, offering a promising approach for therapy.

Now, we can visualize the top ten enriched pathways using the code below.

```python=
sns.barplot(x='intersection_size', y='name', data=pathway_analysis_results.head(10))
plt.title('Top 10 Pathways')
plt.xlabel('Term size')
plt.ylabel('Pathway')
plt.show()
```

Which produces the following output:

##  Conclusion: What is Amilioride's Mechanism of Action? Is It Effective?

Amiloride, traditionally known as a diuretic, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for multiple myeloma, as evidenced by recent studies. The paper ["Amiloride, An Old Diuretic Drug, Is a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Multiple Myeloma"](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/23/21/6602/259285/Amiloride-An-Old-Diuretic-Drug-Is-a-Potential) highlights that amiloride effectively decreases cell growth and induces significant apoptosis in myeloma cells within 24 to 48 hours of treatment, as demonstrated in the image below. These findings are further supported by the gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis results, which reveal that amiloride significantly impacts critical cellular processes, particularly those involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress.

The pathway analysis indicates that amiloride affects key pathways such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and respiratory electron transport. These pathways are crucial for cellular energy production and mitochondrial function. The observed decrease in cell growth and increased apoptosis in myeloma cells can be attributed to amiloride's ability to disrupt these vital energy-producing processes, thereby impairing cancer cell metabolism and inducing cell death. Additionally, the impact on pathways related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) suggests that amiloride may exacerbate oxidative stress, further contributing to its pro-apoptotic effects.

Given these insights, amilorideâ€™s mechanism of action in myeloma cells appears to involve the disruption of energy metabolism and induction of oxidative stress, which together inhibit cell growth and promote apoptosis. The combination of these effects makes amiloride a compelling candidate for further investigation as a potential myeloma therapy. Its existing clinical use as a diuretic and its demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models warrant deeper exploration to assess its therapeutic potential and safety in treating multiple myeloma.
